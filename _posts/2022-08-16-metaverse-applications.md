Everyone has heard somewhere about the new trend - the <b>metaverse</b>.

But its possible applications are manifold. The human being
must broaden his horizons and open up new spaces and possibilities for himself, also in order to help those people who, for health reasons, cannot or more
who, for health reasons, cannot participate in social life or more, are not yet allowed to do so.

But what impact is this going to have on all of our lives in the future?

<h3>Entertainment</h3>
In retroactive terms, technological progress in relation to the video game industry has contributed significantly to the success of today's video games.
The best example of this is the video game Second Life,
which was one of the first to allow users to interact with each other in virtual space back in 2003. As a result, video game platforms such as Fortnite, which currently enjoy international attention, have been a great success. Fortnite, a game in which users, who can create their own avatars in virtual space and battle it out in a virtual war zone, is now enjoying such a surge in popularity that companies are scrambling to sign professional players. According to esportsearnings, some of these players even earn around 3 million US dollars.

<h3>Commerce</h3>
The metaverse, built on the basis of Web 3.0, which includes blockchain, cryptocurrencies and NFT, also offers the trading sector various opportunities. In the past, we have seen a willingness to accept cryptocurrency as a means of payment, especially among various companies. Last year, the first country took the next step and officially declared the cryptocurrency Bitcoin as a means of payment. In a metaverse where all possible means of payment are accepted,
cryptocurrencies can thus also be used in most cases to prove the purchase and ownership of various goods.

<h3>Education</h3>
But the education sector is also benefiting from the current developments around the metaverse - also reinforced once again by the COVD19 era.
Interactive learning from home or generally far away from the educational institution gained a completely new meaning. Virtual classrooms, as they increasingly appeared, were the first step here.
Virtual class trips, as well as visits to archaeological sites or even to distant worlds, such as the surface of Mars, are the next logical step in development.

<h3>Outlook</h3>
The ease of access to the Internet and the rapid advance of corporations such as Nike, Meta and Apple in the design and construction of a metaverse across national borders requires that the protection of users as well as ensuring compliance with legal realities be ensured.

If I gathered your interest in this topic, then wait eagerly for my paper which deals, among other things, with the effects of the following areas on the above applications of the metaverse.

- Intellectual Property (IP)
- Interoperability
- Data Security & Data Privacy
